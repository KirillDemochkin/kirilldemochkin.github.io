### Hi, welcome to Casual GAN Papers!

My name is **Kirill**, I am a Skoltech MSc graduate in Data Science, and I love Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and especially GANs.

I joined Samsung AI Center, Moscow in 2020 as a research scientist to work on generative computer vision research projects, which are exploding in popularity right now.

That is why I read about 5-7 new papers a week just to stay up to date with all of the new exciting research that is released weekly. 

Reading and understanding all of these ideas is tough, hence I started Casual GAN Papers - to record an easy to understand summary of the main ideas from the most interesting papers that I read as well as my thoughts on those papers.

If you always find yourself saving interesting papers to your reading list, and never acttually reading them because you simply do not have enough time, then **Casual GAN Papers** is for you!
